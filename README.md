# HelthNexus

HelthNexus is a showcase project designed to demonstrate code examples for a data solution aimed at creating valuable insights for the pharmaceutical industry based on healthcare system information.

⚠️ **This project is for demonstration purposes only. The code is not prepared for production use, and the `crawler_manager` module has been significantly cleaned and simplified compared to its production version.**

---

## Features

- **Data Value Creation**: Demonstrates how healthcare system data can be transformed into actionable insights for the pharmaceutical sector.
- **Code Examples**: Provides sample Python scripts for key components of the data solution.
- **Showcase**: Serves as a demonstration of the logic behind a data pipeline solution.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following Python files:

1. **`crawler_manager.py`**  
   - A simplified version of a crawler manager. The production version is more robust.
   - Demonstrates how data from healthcare systems can be gathered efficiently.

2. **Other Python files**  
   - Additional code examples showcasing data processing techniques, transformations, and write techniques.
